## Features

- Easy-to-use structure for implementing and testing JavaScript functions.
- Example files provided to demonstrate how to write functions and corresponding tests.
- Integration with Mocha and Chai for seamless testing and assertions.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codewars-testing.git
   cd codewars-testing
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

This project is structured to allow easy addition of new challenges. Follow these steps to add your own tests:

1. **Add Your Function Implementation**

   - Create a new file for your function in the `src/challenges` directory. 
   - Implement your function and export it.

   ```javascript
   // Example: src/challenges/example.js
   function addNumbers(a, b) {
       return a + b;
   }
   export default addNumbers;
   ```

2. **Create a Test File**

   - Create a corresponding test file in the `src/tests` directory.
   - Use the provided template to write your tests, making sure to import your function.

   ```javascript
   // Example: src/tests/example.test.js
   import { expect } from 'chai';
   import addNumbers from '../challenges/example.js';

   describe("addNumbers Function Tests", () => {
       it("should return the sum of two positive numbers", () => {
           const result = addNumbers(5, 7);
           const expected = 12;
           expect(result).to.equal(expected);
       });
   });
   ```

## File Structure

Here’s a brief overview of the project structure:

```
codewars-testing/
│
├── package.json              # Project metadata and dependencies
├── src/
│   ├── challenges/           # Directory for function implementations
│   │   └── example.js        # Example function implementation
│   │
│   └── tests/                # Directory for test files
│       └── example.test.js   # Example test file
│
└── README.md                 # Project documentation
```

## Example

The project includes example files (`example.js` and `example.test.js`) that demonstrate how to create a function and test it. You can copy and modify these files for your own challenges.

## Running Specific Tests

To run the tests for your function, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test:example
```

You can replace `example` with the name of your test file.

## Running All Tests

To run all tests at once, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```
